# Customizing Templates

This documentation is intentionally elementary. Instead you should review the [knowledgebase](https://sproutapps.co/support/knowledgebase/sprout-invoices/customizing-templates/).

Note: This library is a child theme of twenty fourteen, just in case you want to download the entire library and try out customizing sprout invoice templates.

## Custom Templates

Example templates are available within this library to show files can be overwritten by a (child) theme. It's highly recommended that you copy a fresh version of _each_ template you want to customize (don't copy over any templates you don't want to customize within sprout-invoices-pro/views/templates/*).

## Multiple Custom Templates

Review the invoice-esp.php file within this directory as an example. The selection will be available on the invoice information area.
